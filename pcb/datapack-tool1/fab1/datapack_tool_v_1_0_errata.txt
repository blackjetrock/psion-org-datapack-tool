Psion Organiser datapack Tool V1.0 errata
=========================================

1. Datapack connector is awkward
2. 4k7 pull ups for I2C have wrong footprint
3. Potentiometer needed in vpp supply
4. 3608 dc-dc converter doesn't work and destroys the IC even
   though a 3608 dc-dc module does work.
5. Pin 19 of U2 should go to GND (schematic issue)
6. Data direction of U3 is wrong. Should be high as we want Pico to
   drive the signals to the slot.
7. Make inductor footprint bigger/more universal to allow
   selection of more inductors
